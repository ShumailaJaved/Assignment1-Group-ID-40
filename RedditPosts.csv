1iqh2jw,Selector Sunday Thread,"It's Sunday again, and whatever your week brought you it's time to sit back and relax as you use your infinite wisdom to solve all the problems currently facing a cricket team of your choice. 

Please use this thread to chip in and discuss your weekly suggested team changes, starting XIs, squad picks, or debate those made by others.

A few prompts to get the team cap handout energy going:

* What changes would you make to a team?
* Any new players on the fringe that need to come in? Who makes way?
* What does your side/squad look like for the next upcoming match/series/tournament?
* Do you make changes based on the conditions/pitches of upcoming matches?
* How would you balance the side with batsmen/bowlers/all-rounders/keepers? Sloggers or accumulators? Specialists or multiple role fillers?
* Any all time XIs, combination XIs, or historical team XIs (or changes to historical teams)?",AutoModerator,1739669609.0,2,t3_1iqh2jw

1iqiw17,Steve Smith optimistic about Champions Trophy despite series loss to Sri Lanka,"From the article:

> Australia's stand-in skipper Steve Smith Was unperturbed about the team's Champions Trophy prospects despite the side suffering a 2-0 ODI series reversal against Sri Lanka. 

> Australia have been ravaged by selection issues, with Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Marsh all ruled out of the tournament with injuries. 

> With pacer Mitchell Starc unavailable for selection and all-rounder Marcus Stoinis announcing his retirement from the format earlier this year, it was a much-changed Australia lining up for the ODIs against Sri Lanka.

> The team suffered consecutive losses in the two-match series.

>  In the first ODI, Australia were bowled out for 165 in a chase of 215, while in the second clash, Australia once again struggled, being snuffed out for 107 chasing a target of 282.

> The absence of their frontline pacers has been a problem for Australia, with Sri Lanka's batters making merry, but Smith threw his weight behind the replacements – Nathan Ellis, Ben Dwarshius and Spencer Johnson.

> ""I think they've all got their own unique skills,"" he said. ""For me, captaining them, it's about me communicating with them and trying to get the right option out of them at the right time.

> “They all do it differently, Ben Dwarshius and Spencer Johnson up-top trying to swing the ball back down the line. Sean (Abbott) has terrific lengths, Nathan Ellis has change-ups.”

> With spin expected to be a factor in Pakistan for the Champions Trophy, Smith pointed out that Australia are well-stocked in that regard.

> “Yeah, we've got a couple of spinners as well with (Adam) Zampa and Tanveer (Sangha), who's got a good skill set,"" he said. ""[In] Maxwell and Short, we've got plenty of part-time options.""

> Smith was also asked for his assessment on Jake Fraser-McGurk, who was one of the players brought into Australia's Champions Trophy squad on Wednesday.

> He is known for his flair and aggressive batting, and though the 22-year-old couldn't get going against Sri Lanka, scoring 2 and 9, Smith backed him to come good. 

> ""He's obviously a very aggressive player. 

> He's got all the shots around the ground,"" Smith said. ""It's just about picking the right time to play them.

> “He hasn’t quite gotten going yet, but he played a couple of nice shots out there and we know the talent he possesses.

> ""That's why he's in this squad. He's dangerous, and the wickets in Pakistan suit him.""

> Australia begin their ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025 campaign against England in Lahore on 22 February.

1ipy1gm,Visiting India for IPL/cricket - advice,"Hi fellow cricket fans,
I am a French & Aussie and big cricket fan and I'm thinking of doing a short trip to India from around mid-March to end of March (slightly flexible dates). During my stay I would ideally go and watch a couple of live games in the city I am visiting. Ideally one IPL game would be amazing as I am a big fan of most teams and players, and possibly some other fixtures if they happen?
I have some questions before I book my flights:
1) Which city do you recommend for cricket experience + getting to know Indian lifestyle + visiting other cities nearby? My research has led me to think Bengaluru or Mumbai, would these be a good option?
2) When do we get IPL fixtures released so I can plan a bit better around those dates?
3) Would I easily be able to buy a ticket to a local IPL game? Any things to know about live cricket games in India?
4) Are there any other cricket games non-IPL going on regularly at the IPL venues (Wankhede, Eden Gardens, etc.) so that I could still experience the atmosphere?
5) Any ""must-be-there"" dates or events that I may have missed?

Thank you all so much for any help, and I can't wait to visit!!

Can the cricket bat be altered illegally? Does the umpire check this? Is there a process? In baseball, you can put cork in a wood bat, you can use pine tar (both are illegal)...these are things that have actually happened in a game at the highest level and are now somewhat infamous.

The Test side’s revival was all about **mentality** – removing fear, playing aggressively, and taking the positive option. But with the white-ball team, it feels more like **a skills issue**.

* England’s struggles against **spin** are still painful to watch. Salt, Brook and Livingstone just don’t seem to have a clear plan, while Duckett, Root and Buttler look far more composed. McCullum’s solution is to be **even more aggressive against spin** – but is that really going to work?
* The bowling attack lacks **variety**. A bunch of right-arm quicks with pace but little else. Sam Curran, a left-armer with loads of variations, was ignored again. Meanwhile, Rehan Ahmed was taken on tour but never played, and Liam Dawson continues to be overlooked despite an excellent T20 record.

So what do you reckon? Can England actually compete in this tournament, or are we heading for another disaster?",beneb1981,1739548932.0,13,t3_1ipduqu

1ioe9le,The system has failed and let him down: O'Keefe on Kuhnemann’s bowling action report,"From the article:

> Steve O'Keefe has slammed the situation faced by Matt Kuhnemann, claiming the ""system has failed"" the Australian spinner.

> In a bombshell development in the wake of Australia's 2-0 series win over Sri Lanka, the left-arm orthodox bowler was reported by match officials over a suspect action.

> Kuhnemann starred for the visitors in Galle, taking 16 wickets at 17.18 for the series, but will now be forced to undergo a rigorous testing process to clear his action.

> He will be permitted to play Sheffield Shield throughout the process, but it has left a sour taste in the mouth of O'Keefe, who played nine Tests in the baggy green.

> Speaking on SEN Radio, he questioned how Kuhnemann could have played so many years without issue, while also denying he will have any problems passing the test.

> ﻿""He's played over 100 professional games of cricket in front of match referees in the Big Bash and first-class cricket,"" O'Keefe said.

> ""He would have trained in front of coaches who would have seen his development over the years. I think it might be hyperextension, and I don't think he'll have any issues

> ""In this situation, it can be quite detrimental to the player and the welfare of Matt after a great series in Sri Lanka, he now has to go through this process which is horrible.

> Kuhnemann won't be the only Aussie to undergo the testing process, with Chris Green banned for 90 days a number of years ago﻿ before rectifying his action and returning.

> Brett Lee's action was also scrutinised, along with Shoaib Akhtar's, when the pair was vying to be the fastest bowler in the world, sending down missiles around the 160 km/h mark.

> However, according to O'Keefe, officials need to do more earlier in players careers to eradicate the chances of it backfiring on the international stage.

> ""I'm saying if we don't do this at an early age or identify players in the system with a potentially questionable action [it could get Australia in trouble],"" O'Keefe said.

> ""We don't want it happening at the top end, imagine if we had a tour of India coming up and he's the dominant spinner - he'd be out of it.

> ""In my opinion, the system has failed and let him down, but I do believe there will be nothing to see here for Matt Kuhnemann ... I think he'll be okay.""

1iojw7d,Sri Lanka's Absence: A Loss for the Champions Trophy,"It’s truly disappointing to see Sri Lanka missing out on the Champions Trophy, especially after such a strong showing in ODIs in 2024. They whitewashed India in an ODI series, won a Test against New Zealand, and also defeated New Zealand in an ODI series at home. They held their own in a competitive away series against New Zealand and just recently beat Australia in an ODI, even if it was against a B team.

As cricket fans, it’s a huge loss not to see Sri Lanka in action, especially in an event being held in Asian conditions where they excel. Their ODI side is clearly stronger than Bangladesh’s, and they would have been a serious contender in these conditions.

Unfortunately, the qualification system for the Champions Trophy was bizarre. Limiting the tournament to just 8 teams from the previous ODI World Cup was a poor decision. A format featuring 10 teams split into two groups of 5 would have been far more inclusive and exciting. Sri Lanka’s absence is a reminder of how flawed this qualification system is and how much more thrilling the tournament could have been with them in it.

1iornc2,Advice for watching a test in the Windies,"I'm an Aussie backpacking around South America and recently realised I'm going to be pretty close to the Caribbean around the time the Australian team are touring in June/July. Seems silly not to hop over to one of the islands and watch a test! I would only go to one I think, so am looking for advice from any locals or anyone who's travelled to watch cricket in the region.

The tests are in:

Barbados - Kensington Oval
Grenada - National Cricket Stadium
Jamaica - Sabina Park 

I'm looking for advice on which island is best both as a spectator and also for being a tourist. If you could only go to one, which would you recommend? Do I need to reserve tickets before getting there or can I wait til I'm there?",Coza_1812,1739475832.0,33,t3_1iornc2
